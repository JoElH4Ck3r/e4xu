This project is a set of AS3 classes and some MXML examples to provide an alternative for
Flex Framework.
I have started it as a mere set of utilities for working with XMLs, though the project grew
up into something very different from what it was from the start.

_The project is in early beta, don't use it for production purposes unless you are confident
about what you do_
